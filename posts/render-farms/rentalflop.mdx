description: Rentaflop is a crowdsourced cloud render farm where Blender artists leverage graphics cards from people around the world when theyâ€™re not using them. When 3D artists need to create an animation, instead of lowering the quality of their work to reduce render times or paying thousands to buy or rent the hardware required, they can get fast and affordable rendering without compromising on quality.
